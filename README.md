# MaillabelCompare
Extraction of data from docx file and writing it to another file.

# Details

Two files with Mail addresses labels.
One file[file1] contains all the Mail addresses
another file[file2] contains some rondom mail addresses
Maillabels should be read from file1. If the label is not present in file2 then insert the new entry.

Format for the file should be preserved.

This project is based on one of my random work... It can be altered to your needs.
